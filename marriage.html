      During the wedding ceremony, Kitty thinks to herself 'all this cannot be otherwise.'
      <br>
      This is particularly interesting, as it is both an embrace and rejection of her previous attitude toward society's norms and mores.
      <br>
      Whereas in the past she felt pressured into a negative situation by society, now she feels embraced by society as it encourages her love.
      <br>
      If the situation is examined more closely, however, one finds that Kitty doesn't actually have much choice in the matter.
      <br>
      While she does love Levin, she nearly died the last time she rejected a marriage proposal.
      <br>
      This is pointed out during dinner before the couple's game of secretaire. Levin is claiming that 'a girl who did not get married could find feminine work for herself in her family,'
      <br>
      but Kitty disagrees, saying 'a girl can be in such a position that she cannot enter a family without humiliation.'
      <br>
      Kitty is no longer naive; she is aware that if she rejects another proposal she will find herself in the same situation as last time, perhaps even worse.
      <br>
      Levin believes that his and Kitty's love is above the influence of society's rules and expectations, but he is wrong.
      <br>
      Kitty does love Levin&mdash;but she has no other <a href="choice.html">choice</a>.
