      Alya:
      <br>
      <br>
      Shklovsky felt his homeland being pulled somewhere by a tugboat.
      <br>
      <br>
      "All your sensations are different in an automobile: you feel PROPULSION and peace of mind,
      PROPULSION and anxiety.
      <br>
      <br>
      But everything you feel is conditioned by the sensation of movement pressing against you."
      <br>
      <br>
      The world is still being pulled by something. Do you feel it, Alya?
      <br>
      <br>
      The tugboat hasn't given up. It has no <a href="choice.html">choice</a>.
      "We are losing ourselves, becoming connective tissue."
      <br>
      <br>
      "Yet art needs the local, the vital, the differentiated."
