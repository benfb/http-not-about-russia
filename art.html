      "In Lev Tolstoy, the heroes tailor their <a href="psychology.html">psychology</a> to the action.
      Dostoevsky places the psychology of his characters in contrast to their moral and social significance."
      <br>
      <br>
      "Finally, all contrasts are exhausted. Then one choice remains&mdash;to shift to the components,
      to <a href="intentionalerror.html">sever the connections</a>, which have become scar tissue."
      <br>
      <br>
      In Zoo, everything is tied together by the history of a man's <a href="love.html">love</a> for a woman."
